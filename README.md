# EnvyAndSpite

**ENVY LEADS TO SPITE**

**SPITE LEADS TO MOTIVATION**

**MOTIVATION LEADS TO ART**

An attempt at making an open source ultrakill level loader and editor...

**Important** 

 1. [Please get this version of unity](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2019.4.40)

 2. This mod works only in sandbox.

 2.5. Due to importing the map as a prefab in the sandbox scene, You need to place an enemy on any place that has a floor tag on the "map" and then rebuild navmesh for all enemies to work

 3. For Height references use a default unity cube with the sizes of 4 4 4, that is v1's height in unity or a capsule with 2 2 2

 4. AND MOST OF ALL, BE CREATIVE :D

# HOW IT WORKS

The mod uses a prefab instead of scenes, so you dont have to manually set every value in the scene itself, the loading and spawning of enemies part works via the unity addressable system aka "load this file at the location of the running resources of the game and create this here"

* [Youtube Tutorial.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5iKxAL-R6U)

# HOW TO USE THE EDITOR

* [The required unity project.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o5xY9HRZh7ATEIh0JxT_UfvcNAmiQ0P_/view?usp=sharing)

Unzip this and open unity hub and click the drop down arrow next to add and click from disk and select the folder and open the project it should contain the map inside of the youtube tutorial as a way to understand the editor

me, this was a solo project for the most part

eternalunion, the creator of rude (i wanted to gain access which is the envy part) of which inspired me to make the project after i got denied access (i felt spite), and also he provided the terminal bundle for me + ultrakill's scripts. (do you get the name of the mod now? please laugh.)
