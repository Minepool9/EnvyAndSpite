# EnvyAndSpite

**ENVY LEADS TO SPITE**

**SPITE LEADS TO MOTIVATION**

**MOTIVATION LEADS TO ART**

An attempt at making an open source ultrakill level loader and editor...

[Skip to setting up the editor](https://github.com/Minepool9/EnvyAndSpite?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-use-the-editor)

**Important** 

 1. [Please get this version of unity](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2019.4.40)

 2. This mod works only in sandbox.

 2.5. Due to importing the map as a prefab in the sandbox scene, You need to place an enemy on any place that has a floor tag on the "map" and then rebuild navmesh for all enemies to work

 3. For Height references use a default unity cube with the sizes of 4 4 4, that is v1's height in unity or a capsule with 2 2 2

 4. AND MOST OF ALL, BE CREATIVE :D

# HOW IT WORKS

The mod uses a prefab instead of scenes, so you dont have to manually set every value in the scene itself, the loading and spawning of enemies part works via the unity addressable system aka "load this file at the location of the running resources of the game and create this here"

# HOW TO USE THE EDITOR

* [Unity project template](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bQqtKBc1EgdyeqjoeizW1McUwThXjN_5/view?usp=sharing)

Alright, first off you're gonna want to go get both [unity hub](<https://unity.com/download>) and [unity 2019 4 40](<https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2019.4.40>) and the unity project from the [repo](<https://github.com/Minepool9/EnvyAndSpite>)  and run first the unity editor installer and install that

Then run the unity hub exe, register an account with unity and make a personal licence (free) you can check out this [tutorial](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg9Mb9xH7MY>) (watch until 1:22) and after that you should be ready to go, but if you get a window like the first image click on "locate existing install" and depending on where you installed the editor it's default location is "C:\Program Files\Unity 2019.4.40f1" and set it to that or to the editor folder if that doesnt work  then click the arrow next to "Add" and select from disk and then unzip the unity project from the repo and just select the folder from it (it should be called "huhadsdas - Copy" select that)

me, this was a solo project for the most part

eternalunion, the creator of rude (i wanted to gain access which is the envy part) of which inspired me to make the project after i got denied access (i felt spite), and also he provided the terminal bundle for me + ultrakill's scripts. (do you get the name of the mod now? please laugh.)
